Python Programs to model solar irradiation on tilted surfaces

==============
In this project, I wrote a few programs to model the solar irradiation on a tilted surface using the HDKR and Perez models for an anisotropic sky. So, given the solar irradiation data for a given location (Phoenix, AZ), we can caluclate the diffuse, beam, and ground reflected components that would be incident on a tilted surface (eg. a solar panel). 

The tracking programs show the same data but with a tracking system implemented to maximize the incident radiation on the surface.
